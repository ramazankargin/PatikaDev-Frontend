        <p>
            Hello I am Ramazan! Over the past 2 years I have held
            various roles in the field of
            information technology and web
            development and currently perform
            desktop support at my work place. I
            have a proven track record of
            planning and implementing
            successful development web pages
            across a range of channels.

            <p>
                Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner. Gardner has invested heavily in a device known as a <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: medium;"> "bone density scanner"</span>. He feels like he has it made selling these devices. However, they do not sell well as they are marginally better than x-ray at a much higher price. As Gardner works to make ends meet, his wife leaves him and he loses his apartment. Forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner continues to sell bone density scanners while concurrently taking on an unpaid internship as a stockbroker, with slim chances for advancement to a paid position. Before he can receive pay, he needs to outshine the competition through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices to stay afloat. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> —John Wiggins, Alf Fonz</span>
